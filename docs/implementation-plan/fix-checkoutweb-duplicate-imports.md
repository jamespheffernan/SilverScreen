# Implementation Plan â€” Fix CheckoutWeb Duplicate Imports

- Branch Name: `fix-checkoutweb-duplicate-imports`
- Related: CheckoutWeb.tsx linter errors

## Background and Motivation
The `app/src/screens/CheckoutWeb.tsx` file has syntax errors due to duplicate imports and malformed file structure. This is blocking the build and needs immediate fix.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The file has:
1. Duplicate import of `Elements` from `@stripe/react-stripe-js` (lines 3 and 57)
2. Missing import of `loadStripe` at the top of the file
3. Import statements in the middle of the file (lines 56-57) that should be at the top
4. Orphaned closing braces and parenthesis at the end (lines 68-69)

## High-level Task Breakdown
1) Create feature branch
- Steps: create branch `fix-checkoutweb-duplicate-imports` from `main`
- Success: branch exists locally

2) Fix the CheckoutWeb.tsx file
- Steps: 
  a. Add `loadStripe` import from `@stripe/stripe-js` at the top
  b. Remove duplicate imports on lines 56-57
  c. Remove orphaned closing syntax on lines 68-69
- Success: File compiles without linter errors

3) Test the fix
- Steps: Run the app locally and verify checkout screen loads
- Success: No TypeScript errors, checkout screen functional

4) Commit and push
- Steps: Commit with message "fix: resolve duplicate imports and syntax errors in CheckoutWeb"
- Success: Changes committed and pushed
